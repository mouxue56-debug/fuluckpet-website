    "content": "<p>Many people struggle with whether to purchase a cat from a breeder or a pet shop. Here is a comparison of each option\\'s key characteristics.</p>\n<h2>Differences in Health Management</h2>\n<p>Reputable breeders conduct genetic testing on parent cats and manage the risk of hereditary diseases. They carefully examine each kitten\\'s health and ensure proper vaccinations and deworming. With pet shops, it is often difficult to verify the health management practices of the supplying breeder.</p>\n<h2>Differences in Socialization</h2>\n<p>Kittens that have spent sufficient time with their mother and siblings at a breeder tend to be more sociable and friendly. At Fuluck Cattery, we conduct our own socialization training program to ensure a smooth transition to your home.</p>\n<h2>After-Sales Support</h2>\n<p>A major advantage of purchasing from a breeder is the ability to consult about care even after bringing your kitten home. You receive advice from an expert who specializes in that particular breed.</p>\n<h2>About Pricing</h2>\n<p>Breeders may be slightly more expensive, but it is important to evaluate the total value including health management, socialization, and after-sales support.</p>"
