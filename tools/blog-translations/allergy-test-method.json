    "title": "Cat Allergy Testing Methods | Blood Tests vs. Prick Tests: Differences and Costs",
    "content": "<p>To accurately determine whether you have a cat allergy, allergy testing at a medical facility is recommended. Here we explain the main testing methods, their characteristics, and costs.</p>\n<h2>Blood Test (Specific IgE Test)</h2>\n<p>This test measures the amount of IgE antibodies against cat allergens (such as Fel d1) in your blood. It only requires a small blood sample, and results are graded on a 7-level scale from Class 0 (negative) to Class 6 (strongly positive).</p>\n<p>With insurance coverage, the cost is approximately 3,000\u20135,000 yen for a single cat allergen test. Panel tests like View39 or MAST that check multiple allergens simultaneously cost around 7,000\u201315,000 yen. Results take 1\u20132 weeks.</p>\n<h2>Prick Test (Skin Test)</h2>\n<p>A small amount of allergen extract is placed on the skin and lightly pricked with a needle. The reaction (redness and swelling) is observed after 15\u201320 minutes. Results are available immediately and the test is more accurate than blood tests.</p>\n<p>However, only a limited number of medical facilities offer this test. It cannot produce accurate results if you are taking antihistamines, so you need to stop the medication beforehand.</p>\n<h2>Where to Get Tested</h2>\n<p>Testing is available at allergy clinics, ENT clinics, dermatology clinics, pediatric clinics, and internal medicine clinics. Prick tests are limited to larger hospitals and specialized allergy clinics. Start by consulting your regular doctor.</p>\n<h2>Test Results and the Decision to Own a Cat</h2>\n<p>With mild allergies at Class 2\u20133, there is a possibility of living with a cat by combining a low-allergen breed like the Siberian with appropriate preventive measures. For moderate to severe allergies at Class 4 or above, please make a careful decision in consultation with an allergy specialist.</p>"

    "content": "<p>要准确了解自己是否有猫过敏，建议到医疗机构进行过敏检测。下面介绍主要的检测方法、特点和费用。</p>\n<h2>血液检查（特异性IgE检测）</h2>\n<p>该检查通过测量血液中针对猫过敏原（Fel d1等）的IgE抗体含量来判断。只需采集少量血液即可检测，结果分为0级（阴性）到6级（强阳性）共7个等级。</p>\n<p>使用医保后费用约为3,000~5,000日元（单项猫过敏原检测）。同时检测多种过敏原的View39或MAST等套餐检测费用约为7,000~15,000日元。出结果需要1~2周。</p>\n<h2>点刺试验（皮肤测试）</h2>\n<p>在皮肤上滴少量过敏原提取液，用针轻刺，15~20分钟后观察反应（红肿）。可以当场得到结果，精度比血液检查更高。</p>\n<p>不过，能做此项检查的医疗机构有限，且服用抗组胺药期间无法得到准确结果，需要提前停药。</p>\n<h2>可以接受检测的地方</h2>\n<p>过敏科、耳鼻喉科、皮肤科、儿科、内科均可接受检测。点刺试验仅限于大型医院或过敏专科诊所。建议先咨询您的家庭医生。</p>\n<h2>检测结果与养猫决策</h2>\n<p>如果是2~3级的轻度过敏，通过选择西伯利亚猫等低过敏原猫种并配合适当的防护措施，有可能实现共同生活。4级以上的中重度过敏，请在过敏专科医生的指导下谨慎判断。</p>"
