    "content": "<p>Cat obesity increases the risk of various health issues including diabetes, joint diseases, and urinary tract disorders. Indoor cats especially need attention since their exercise is limited.</p>\n    <h2>How to Identify a Healthy Weight</h2>\n    <p>Use the Body Condition Score (BCS) to assess your cat. The ideal condition (BCS 3 on a 5-point scale) is when you can feel the ribs through a thin layer of fat and see a slight waist when viewed from above.</p>\n    <h2>Diet Management to Prevent Obesity</h2>\n    <p>Follow the feeding amounts listed on the food package, and keep treats to within 10% of daily total calories. After neutering or spaying, metabolism decreases, so it is recommended to reduce food portions by 10 to 15%.</p>\n    <h2>Exercise Tips</h2>\n    <p>Ensure about 15 to 20 minutes of play time every day. Cat wands, laser pointers (end with a treat for a sense of achievement), and puzzle feeders are effective. Providing a cat tree for vertical movement is also important.</p>"

    "content": "<p>猫咪肥胖会增加糖尿病、关节疾病、泌尿系统疾病等多种健康风险。尤其是室内猫，运动量受到限制，更需要注意。</p>\n    <h2>如何判断适当体重</h2>\n    <p>可以使用体况评分（BCS）来判断。理想状态（5级评分中的第3级）是隔着薄薄的脂肪能摸到肋骨，从上方看有轻微的腰部曲线。</p>\n    <h2>通过饮食管理预防肥胖</h2>\n    <p>按照猫粮包装上标注的喂食量喂食，零食不超过每日总热量的10%。绝育后代谢会降低，建议将食量减少10%至15%。</p>\n    <h2>运动方面的建议</h2>\n    <p>每天确保约15至20分钟的游戏时间。逗猫棒、激光笔（最后用零食奖励给予成就感）、益智喂食器都很有效。设置猫爬架增加上下运动的机会也很重要。</p>"
