    "content": "<p>For cats, moving means the loss of their territory and is a major source of stress. By following a timeline-based approach, you can minimize the burden on your beloved cat.</p>\n<h2>Two Weeks Before the Move</h2>\n<p>Place the carrier bag out in the room with a favorite blanket inside, allowing your cat to come and go freely. If the moving company needs to do a pre-move inspection, keep your cat in a separate room. As packing boxes pile up, your cat may become anxious, so try to keep their living space as normal as possible.</p>\n<h2>Moving Day</h2>\n<p>During the move, keep your cat in a separate room or carrier, isolated from the workers coming and going. Be extra careful to prevent escape during the busy period of doors opening and closing. Cover the carrier with a towel during transport to create a dark, calming environment. If your cat meows a lot in the car, using a pheromone spray (such as Feliway) inside the carrier can be effective.</p>\n<h2>The First Week at the New Home</h2>\n<p>Start by confining your cat to just one room with their litter box, food, water, and bed. Be sure to include blankets and towels from the previous home that carry your cat's own scent. Once your cat has settled in, gradually expand their territory one room at a time over several days.</p>"

    "content": "<p>对猫咪来说，搬家意味着领地的丧失，是一个巨大的应激事件。按照时间线做好应对，可以将爱猫的负担降到最低。</p>\n<h2>搬家前两周</h2>\n<p>将航空箱放在房间里，里面铺上猫咪喜欢的毯子，让它自由进出。如果搬家公司需要上门勘察，请将猫咪转移到其他房间。随着打包纸箱增多，猫咪可能会感到不安，因此尽量保持猫咪活动空间与平时一致。</p>\n<h2>搬家当天</h2>\n<p>搬运过程中，将猫咪关在单独的房间或航空箱内，与搬运工人隔离。在门频繁开关的时段，要特别注意防止猫咪逃跑。运输途中在航空箱上盖一条毛巾营造昏暗环境，帮助猫咪安心。如果猫咪在车内持续叫唤，可以在航空箱内使用费洛蒙喷雾（如Feliway），效果显著。</p>\n<h2>新家的第一周</h2>\n<p>首先只让猫咪待在一个房间里，摆放好猫砂盆、猫粮、饮水和猫窝。务必放置从旧居带来的、带有猫咪自身气味的毯子和毛巾。等猫咪安定下来后，再花几天时间逐个房间扩大活动范围。</p>"
