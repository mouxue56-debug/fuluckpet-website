    "content": "<p>Treats are a great tool for bonding with your cat and offering rewards, but improper use can lead to obesity and picky eating.</p>\n    <h2>Proper Treat Portions</h2>\n    <p>Treats should be kept within 10% of your cat's total daily calorie intake. A 4 kg cat needs roughly 250-280 kcal per day, so treats should be limited to about 25-28 kcal.</p>\n    <h2>Types of Treats and How to Choose</h2>\n    <p>Paste-type treats (such as Churu) are highly palatable and also useful for administering medication. Freeze-dried meat has fewer additives and is a safe choice. Dental care treats also help maintain dental health. Choose products with simple ingredient lists.</p>\n    <h2>Important Notes</h2>\n    <p>Giving too many treats can cause your cat to refuse their regular food. Treats should only serve as a supplement; the foundation of nutrition should come from a complete and balanced cat food.</p>\n    "
