    "content": "<p>Cat spraying is a marking behavior in which cats spray urine on walls and furniture. The strong odor makes it a major issue for indoor cats.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2><p>The main causes are territorial assertion, being in heat, stress, and anxiety. It is most common in unneutered males, but females may also spray.</p>\n<h2>The Most Effective Solution</h2><p>Neutering or spaying is the most effective measure. Approximately 90% of unneutered male cats stop spraying after surgery. However, if the behavior has become a long-established habit, it may continue even after surgery, so early neutering is recommended.</p>\n<h2>Other Measures</h2><p>Eliminating sources of stress, using pheromone products, and improving the litter box environment can also be effective. Thoroughly clean sprayed areas with an enzyme-based cleaner to remove the scent.</p>\n    "

    "content": "<p>猫咪的喷尿行为是指猫在墙壁和家具上喷洒尿液的标记行为。气味强烈，对于室内饲养来说是一个很大的问题。</p>\n<h2>原因</h2><p>主要原因包括领地宣示、发情、压力和不安。未绝育的公猫最为常见，但母猫也可能出现这种行为。</p>\n<h2>最有效的对策</h2><p>绝育手术是最有效的方法。约90%的未绝育公猫在手术后会停止喷尿行为。但如果行为已经长期固化，手术后可能仍会持续，因此建议尽早进行绝育手术。</p>\n<h2>其他对策</h2><p>消除压力来源、使用费洛蒙产品、改善猫砂盆环境等也很有效。喷尿过的地方请使用酶类清洁剂彻底去除气味。</p>\n    "
