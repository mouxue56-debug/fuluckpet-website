    "content": "<p>A kitten's weight is an important indicator of their health. By recording it regularly, you can quickly identify whether growth is on track and catch any health issues early.</p>\n    <h2>How to Weigh Your Kitten</h2>\n    <p>A kitchen scale works well for this purpose. Place the kitten in a small container and weigh them. Weighing at the same time of day each time makes comparison easier. Record the weight once or twice a week.</p>\n    <h2>Signs of Healthy Growth</h2>\n    <p>A healthy kitten gains approximately 10-15 grams per day. If the weight remains unchanged or decreases over a week, it may indicate nutritional deficiency or health problems, so consult your veterinarian.</p>\n    <h2>Weight Management at Fuluck Cattery</h2>\n    <p>At Fuluck Cattery, we regularly record the weight of all our kittens and monitor their healthy growth.
