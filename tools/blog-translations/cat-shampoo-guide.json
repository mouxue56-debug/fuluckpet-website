For long-haired breeds, once every few months is a good guideline. If your cat is extremely dirty or has skin issues, consult your veterinarian before bathing.</p>\n    <h2>What You Will Need</h2>\n    <p>Cat-specific shampoo (never use human shampoo), a basin, 2 to 3 towels, and a hair dryer. Water temperature should be lukewarm at 36 to 38 degrees Celsius.</p>\n    <h2>Washing Steps</h2>\n    <p>1. Brush thoroughly to remove tangles. 2. Wet the entire body with lukewarm water (avoid the face). 3. Lather the shampoo and wash gently. 4. Rinse thoroughly. 5. Absorb moisture well with towels. 6. Dry with a hair dryer (on low setting, held at a distance).</p>\n    <h2>Socialization at Fuluck Cattery</h2>\n    <p>At Fuluck Cattery, shower and hair dryer training begins at around 60 days of age.
