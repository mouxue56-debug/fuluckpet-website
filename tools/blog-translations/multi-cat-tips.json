    "content": "<p>Keeping multiple cats promotes social interaction between them and reduces loneliness when you're away from home. However, success requires a proper environment and careful introductions.</p>\n<h2>Cat Breeds Suited for Multi-Cat Households</h2>\n<p>Gentle and sociable breeds such as Siberians, Ragdolls, and British Shorthairs are well-suited for multi-cat living. Siberians in particular have strong cohabitation skills with other cats, and introductions go relatively smoothly not only between kittens but also with adult cats.</p>\n<h2>Three Essential Environmental Rules</h2>\n<p>1. Provide \"number of cats + 1\" litter boxes. 2. Place food bowls and water dishes equal to the number of cats in separate locations. 3. Ensure each cat has a safe space of their own (high perches, hiding spots, favorite sleeping areas).</p>\n<h2>Signs of Poor Compatibility</h2>\n<p>Persistent hissing or aggression, one-sided chasing, one cat being unable to eat, or one cat constantly hiding are all signs of compatibility problems. Using pheromone diffusers or reconfiguring the living space may help improve the situation.</p>\n    "
