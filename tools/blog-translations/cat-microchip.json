    "content": "<p>Since June 2022, microchip implantation has been mandatory for dogs and cats sold by breeders and pet shops in Japan.</p>\n    <h2>What Is a Microchip?</h2>\n    <p>It is a small electronic chip approximately 2mm in diameter and 12mm in length, injected under the cat's skin (usually at the back of the neck) using a syringe. The chip stores a unique 15-digit identification number that can be read with a dedicated scanner to match owner information.</p>\n    <h2>Benefits</h2>\n    <p>A microchip greatly increases the chances of reuniting with your cat if they get lost. While collars and ID tags can fall off, a microchip stays in place since it is implanted inside the body. It is also useful for identification during disasters.</p>\n    <h2>Cost Estimates</h2>\n    <p>Implantation costs approximately 3,000-5,000 yen, and registration costs approximately 300-1,000 yen. Cats from breeders are often already microchipped.</p>\n    <h2>Fuluck Cattery's Approach</h2>\n    <p>At Fuluck Cattery, we implant microchips in eligible kittens before handing them over. Please feel free to contact us for details about individual cases.</p>"

    "content": "<p>自2022年6月起，日本要求繁育人和宠物店出售的犬猫必须植入芯片。</p>\n    <h2>什么是芯片</h2>\n    <p>芯片是一种直径约2毫米、长约12毫米的微型电子芯片，通过注射器植入猫咪皮下（通常在颈部后方）。芯片中记录了15位唯一编号，通过专用读取器扫描后可以查询到主人的信息。</p>\n    <h2>优点</h2>\n    <p>猫咪走失时，芯片能大大提高找回的概率。项圈和名牌可能会脱落，但芯片植入体内不会脱落。在灾害时也有助于确认身份。</p>\n    <h2>费用参考</h2>\n    <p>植入费用约3,000-5,000日元，登记费用约300-1,000日元。从繁育人处迎接的猫咪通常已经植入了芯片。</p>\n    <h2>福楽猫舍的做法</h2>\n    <p>福楽猫舍会在交付前为符合条件的幼猫植入芯片。具体情况请随时联系我们咨询。</p>"
