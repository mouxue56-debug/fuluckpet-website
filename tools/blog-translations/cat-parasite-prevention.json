    "content": "<p>Even indoor cats are not completely free from parasite risks. Owners can bring parasites in from outside, or infection can occur when introducing a new cat to the household.</p>\n    <h2>Common External Parasites</h2>\n    <h3>Fleas</h3><p>The most common external parasite in cats. They cause itching and can lead to allergic dermatitis and tapeworm transmission. Monthly spot-on (topical) treatments can effectively prevent fleas.</p>\n    <h3>Ticks</h3><p>More common in outdoor cats, but humans can bring them indoors as well. Ticks can transmit serious diseases such as SFTS (Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome), so caution is necessary.</p>\n    <h2>Common Internal Parasites</h2>\n    <h3>Roundworms</h3><p>Common in kittens and can be transmitted from the mother cat. They cause diarrhea and abdominal bloating.</p>\n    <h3>Tapeworms</h3><p>Transmitted through fleas. If you notice small white rice-grain-like segments around your cat's rear end, tapeworm infection is a possibility.</p>\n    <h2>Key Prevention Measures</h2>\n    <p>Regular deworming (as directed by your veterinarian) and routine flea prevention medication are the basics. Fuluck Cattery performs deworming before handing over all kittens.</p>"
