    "content": "<p>Getting bitten by your cat can be painful. By understanding the reasons behind biting, you can take the right steps to correct this behavior.</p>\n<h2>The Difference Between Gentle Biting and Serious Biting</h2><p>Gentle biting (love bites) is an extension of play or a form of communication — the cat controls the force. Serious biting is triggered by fear, pain, or overstimulation and can result in deep wounds.</p>\n<h2>How to Address Biting Habits</h2><p>When your cat bites, say \"ouch\" in a low, firm voice and immediately stop playing. Avoid playing with your cat using your bare hands — always use toys instead so your cat learns that hands are not for biting. It's also important to give your cat plenty of active play sessions with feather wands and chase games to help them burn off excess energy.</p>"
