    "content": "<p>Cats can have food allergies too, which may manifest as skin itching or digestive symptoms.</p>\n    <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>\n    <p>Typical symptoms include itching and redness around the face, ears, and neck, recurring vomiting or diarrhea, and hair loss. Since it can be difficult to distinguish from environmental allergies (house dust, pollen, etc.), a veterinary diagnosis is necessary.</p>\n    <h2>Common Allergen Ingredients</h2>\n    <p>Beef, dairy products, fish, chicken, and wheat are among the most common food allergens for cats. However, individual sensitivities vary greatly.</p>\n    <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>\n    <p>Diagnosis is made through an elimination diet trial, where a novel protein or hydrolyzed protein food is fed for 8-12 weeks. If improvement is seen, the original food is gradually reintroduced to identify the specific allergen.</p>\n    "
