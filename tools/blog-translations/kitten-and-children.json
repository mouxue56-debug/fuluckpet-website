Let's establish some safety rules.</p>\n<h2>Rules to Teach Children</h2><p>Teach basic rules such as: touch gently (no hitting or pulling), don't pull the tail or ears, let go when the cat shows displeasure, don't wake a sleeping cat, and don't make loud noises.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the Right Breed</h2><p>Siberians are one of the breeds that get along well with children. They are calm and patient, and kittens raised in a family environment are accustomed to children's movements. Fuluck Cattery raises kittens in an environment with children, so we can confidently recommend them to families with kids.</p>\n    "
