    "content": "<p>Parting with a beloved cat is heartbreaking, but it helps to know how to prepare for a peaceful farewell.</p>\n<h2>Signs of End of Life</h2><p>You may observe changes such as refusing all food, no longer drinking water, decreased body temperature, changes in breathing, seeking hiding places, and becoming less responsive.</p>\n<h2>Home Hospice Care</h2><p>Place your cat in a quiet, warm spot and wrap them in a soft blanket. Do not force-feed; simply moistening their lips is sufficient care. Being by their side, speaking gently, and petting them is the greatest comfort you can provide.</p>\n<h2>Consulting Your Veterinarian</h2><p>If your cat is in severe pain, consult your veterinarian about palliative care such as pain medication. If necessary, it is important to have an honest discussion with your vet about the option of euthanasia.</p>\n<h2>Coping with Pet Loss</h2><p>Grief is a natural emotion. Allow yourself to fully mourn. Creating a memory album, writing a letter, or talking with others who have had similar experiences can be healing. Consulting a pet loss counseling specialist is also a good option.</p>\n    "
