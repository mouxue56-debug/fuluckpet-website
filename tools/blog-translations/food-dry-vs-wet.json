    "content": "<p>Many people wonder whether to feed dry food or wet food. Let's compare the pros and cons of each.</p>\n    <h2>Pros and Cons of Dry Food</h2>\n    <p>Pros include easy storage, good cost performance, and a tendency to cause less tartar buildup. The downside is its low moisture content (about 10%), so additional water intake is necessary.</p>\n    <h2>Pros and Cons of Wet Food</h2>\n    <p>Pros include high moisture content (about 70-80%) which helps with hydration, high palatability, and lower calories. Cons are a shorter shelf life after opening and higher cost.</p>\n    <h2>We Recommend Combining Both</h2>\n    <p>The ideal approach is to combine dry and wet food. By using dry food as the base and adding one meal of wet food per day, you can increase water intake while maintaining nutritional balance.</p>\n    "
