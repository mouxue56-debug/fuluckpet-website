    "content": "<p>Hiding is a natural defensive instinct for cats. It is especially common right after bringing a cat home or when their environment changes.</p>\n<h2>Common Reasons for Hiding</h2><p>The main reasons include wariness of a new environment, fear or stress, feeling unwell, a noisy environment, and the presence of visitors.</p>\n<h2>What to Do Right After Bringing Your Cat Home</h2><p>First of all, don't worry too much -- hiding is perfectly normal behavior. Don't try to pull your cat out. Instead, provide a safe hiding spot and place food, water, and a litter box nearby. Keep quiet and let your cat come out at their own pace. In most cases, they will start to feel comfortable within a few hours to a few days.</p>\n    <h2>When to Be Concerned</h2><p>If your cat hasn't eaten or drunk anything for more than 2 days, or appears lethargic, they may be feeling unwell. Please consult your veterinarian.</p>"
