    "content": "<p>If a baby is joining a household with cats, there are some precautions to keep in mind, but safe cohabitation is entirely possible with proper measures. Some research even suggests that children raised around cats are less likely to develop allergies.</p>\n<h2>Pregnancy Precautions: Toxoplasmosis</h2>\n<p>Toxoplasmosis can affect the fetus if a first-time infection occurs during pregnancy. However, the risk of infection from a strictly indoor cat is extremely low. As a precaution, have other family members handle litter box cleaning during pregnancy. If concerned, a blood test is available at your obstetrician\\'s office.</p>\n<h2>Preparing Before the Baby Arrives</h2>\n<p>Install baby gates to prevent cats from entering the baby\\'s room. Help your cat get used to the sound of a baby crying by playing recordings at low volume. Also familiarize your cat with the scent of baby cream and baby powder in advance. Ensure your cat has a dedicated safe retreat space.</p>\n<h2>Cohabitation Rules After Birth</h2>\n<p>Never leave the baby and cat alone together unsupervised. Do not let the cat sleep near the baby\\'s bed or bouncer. Keep the cat\\'s nails trimmed short at all times. Wash your hands before and after touching the baby. Make sure to give your cat plenty of love and playtime to prevent jealousy and stress.</p>"

    "content": "<p>如果养猫的家庭即将迎来宝宝，虽然有一些注意事项，但只要做好适当的准备就能安全共处。也有研究报告指出，在有猫的环境中成长的孩子更不容易过敏。</p>\n<h2>孕期注意事项：弓形虫</h2>\n<p>弓形虫病如果在孕期首次感染，可能会影响胎儿。但完全室内饲养的猫传染的风险极低。为了安全起见，孕期请让其他家庭成员负责清理猫厕所。如果担心，可以在产科做血液检查。</p>\n<h2>宝宝出生前的准备</h2>\n<p>安装婴儿门防止猫进入宝宝的房间。为了让猫适应婴儿的哭声，可以从小音量开始播放录音。也要提前让猫适应婴儿霜和爽身粉的气味。确保为猫准备一个专用的安全避难空间。</p>\n<h2>产后同居规则</h2>\n<p>绝对不要让宝宝和猫单独相处。不要让猫在宝宝的床或摇椅附近睡觉。始终保持猫的指甲修剪整齐。接触宝宝前后要洗手。确保给猫足够的关爱和玩耍时间，预防嫉妒和压力。</p>"
