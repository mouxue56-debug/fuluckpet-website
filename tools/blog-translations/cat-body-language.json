    "content": "<p>Cats communicate their feelings through body language instead of words. By learning to read these signals, you can build a better relationship with your cat.</p>\n<h2>Tail Language</h2><p>Tail held high while approaching you = happy, greeting. Slow swaying = relaxed. Rapid thrashing = irritated or excited. Puffed up = frightened or defensive. Tucked between legs = fearful or anxious.</p>\n<h2>Ear Language</h2><p>Facing forward = interested or relaxed. Flattened sideways (\"airplane ears\") = uneasy or irritated. Pinned back = frightened or preparing to attack. Swiveling around = alert and scanning.</p>\n<h2>Body Posture</h2><p>Belly exposed = trust (though some cats may still dislike belly touches). Back arched with fur standing on end = frightened. Slow blinking = expression of affection. Head rubbing against you = scent marking combined with affection.</p>"
