    "content": "<p>Cat socialization training is the process of helping kittens become accustomed to people and their environment so they grow into calm, well-adjusted cats.</p>\n<h2>What Is the Socialization Period?</h2><p>The cat socialization period is generally considered to be from about 2 to 7 weeks of age. Experiences during this window are more readily accepted even in adulthood, making it a critical time for getting used to people and everyday sounds.</p>\n<h2>Socialization at Fuluck Cattery</h2><p>At Fuluck Cattery, we raise kittens in a home environment where they interact with children and other animals for natural socialization. They become accustomed to everyday sounds such as televisions and vacuum cleaners, as well as children's voices, and we also practice bathing, blow-drying, and nail trimming. Thanks to this approach, our kittens can adapt to their new homes with minimal stress after adoption.</p>\n    <h2>What You Can Do After Bringing Your Kitten Home</h2><p>You can continue socialization in everyday life by introducing your kitten to various people, gradually exposing them to different sounds, and gently handling their body. However, forcing interactions is counterproductive, so always respect your cat's pace.</p>"
