    "title": "Tips for Leaving Your Cat Home Alone: How Many Days Is Safe? A Comprehensive Guide",
    "content": "<p>When you need to be away from home for travel or business, how long can your cat safely stay home alone? Here are key points for ensuring your cat's safety during your absence.</p>\n<h2>Guidelines for How Long Cats Can Stay Home Alone</h2>\n<p>A healthy adult cat can generally manage being alone for about one night (up to two days). However, stays of two nights or more require some form of support. Kittens under 6 months old should not be left alone for more than half a day, and senior cats (10 years and older) require careful consideration before being left alone for more than a day.</p>\n<h2>Preparation Checklist for a One-Night Absence</h2>\n<p>Set up an automatic feeder to manage meal times. Provide water in at least 3 locations (an automatic water fountain is ideal). Prepare at least 2 clean litter boxes. Set the air conditioner (28\u00b0C in summer, 20\u00b0C in winter). Install a pet monitoring camera. Place toys around the home.</p>\n<h2>Options for Stays of Two Nights or More</h2>\n<p>A pet sitter who comes to your home is the least stressful option for cats, as there is no change in environment. A pet hotel involves a significant environmental change, which can be stressful for cats, but offers the benefit of 24-hour care. You can also consider entrusting your cat to a trusted friend or acquaintance.</p>\n    "

    "content": "<p>因旅行或出差需要离家时，猫咪独自看家最多能坚持多久？以下为您介绍安全留猫看家的要点。</p>\n<h2>可独自看家的天数参考</h2>\n<p>健康的成年猫一般可以独自看家1晚2天左右。但2晚以上就需要某种形式的照顾支持。6个月以下的幼猫不宜独自留守超过半天，10岁以上的老年猫独自留守超过1天也需慎重考虑。</p>\n<h2>1晚2天的看家准备清单</h2>\n<p>用自动喂食器管理进食时间、在3个以上的位置放置饮水（最好是自动饮水器）、准备2个以上干净的猫砂盆、设定空调（夏季28\u00b0C、冬季20\u00b0C）、安装监控摄像头、摆放玩具。</p>\n<h2>2晚以上的选择</h2>\n<p>上门喂猫服务（宠物保姆）对猫咪来说压力最小，因为不需要改变环境。宠物酒店虽然环境变化大，会给猫咪带来较大压力，但可以获得24小时照顾。也可以考虑托付给信赖的朋友或熟人。</p>\n    "
