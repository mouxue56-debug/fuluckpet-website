    "content": "<p>Cat shedding season mainly occurs in spring (winter coat to summer coat) and autumn (summer coat to winter coat). Long-haired breeds like Siberians shed particularly heavily during these periods.</p>\n    <h2>Shedding Season Care</h2>\n    <h3>Daily Brushing</h3>\n    <p>During shedding season, daily brushing is ideal. A Furminator is especially effective for efficiently removing the undercoat.</p>\n    <h3>Shampooing</h3>\n    <p>Shampooing during shedding season can remove a large amount of loose undercoat at once. However, frequent shampooing can cause dry skin, so limit it to about once per shedding season.</p>\n    <h2>Indoor Cleaning</h2>\n    <p>Using a robot vacuum, setting up an air purifier, and keeping lint rollers handy are all recommended. Placing washable covers on your cat's favorite lounging spots is also effective.</p>"

    "content": "<p>猫咪的换毛期主要在春季（冬毛换夏毛）和秋季（夏毛换冬毛）到来。尤其是像西伯利亚猫这样的长毛品种，这个时期的掉毛量会非常大。</p>\n    <h2>换毛期的护理</h2>\n    <h3>每日梳毛</h3>\n    <p>换毛期理想状态是每天梳毛。去底绒梳（Furminator）在高效去除底层绒毛方面特别有效。</p>\n    <h3>洗澡</h3>\n    <p>换毛期洗澡可以一次性去除大量多余的底层绒毛。但频繁洗澡会导致皮肤干燥，建议每个换毛期只洗一次左右。</p>\n    <h2>室内清洁</h2>\n    <p>建议使用扫地机器人、安装空气净化器、常备衣物粘毛器。在猫咪经常休息的地方铺上可水洗的布套也很有效。</p>"
