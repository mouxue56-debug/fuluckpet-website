    "content": "<p>A cat's ears are a barometer of their health. Check them regularly and clean them as needed.</p>\n    <h2>Signs That Ear Cleaning Is Needed</h2>\n    <p>Ear cleaning is necessary when you notice brown or black buildup inside the ears, when there's an odor, or when your cat is frequently scratching at their ears.</p>\n    <h2>Proper Ear Cleaning Steps</h2>\n    <p>Place a few drops of cat-specific ear cleaning solution (ear cleaner) into the ear canal, then gently massage the base of the ear. After your cat shakes their head and the solution comes out, gently wipe it away with cotton or gauze. Be careful not to push cotton swabs deep into the ear canal.</p>\n    <h2>Recommended Frequency</h2>\n    <p>For healthy cats, cleaning once or twice a month is sufficient. Cats that produce excessive earwax or are prone to otitis externa (outer ear infections) may need more frequent cleaning.</p>"
