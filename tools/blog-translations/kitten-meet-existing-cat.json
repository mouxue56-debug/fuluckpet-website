Taking it slow and proceeding step by step is the key to success.</p>\n<h2>5-Step Introduction Method</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Separate Rooms (3-7 Days)</h3><p>Keep the kitten in a separate room and let them get used to each other's presence through the door.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Scent Swapping (Several Days)</h3><p>Exchange towels or bedding that each cat has used so they become familiar with each other's scent.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Feeding Through the Door</h3><p>Feed both cats on opposite sides of the door so they associate each other's presence with something positive (mealtime).</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Short Face-to-Face Meetings</h3><p>Open the door slightly for short meetings (5-10 minutes). If there is mild hissing, observe calmly; if it becomes intense, stop the session.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Free Interaction</h3><p>If things go well, gradually increase the time they spend together. It may take several weeks to several months for them to become fully comfortable with each other.</p>\n    "
