    "content": "<p>A cat virus test checks for infection with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV, commonly known as \"cat AIDS\") and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV). It is especially important when welcoming a new cat into your home.</p>\n    <h2>What Is FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus)?</h2>\n    <p>FIV is a virus that weakens a cat's immune system. It is primarily transmitted through bite wounds from other cats. Even after infection, there is often a long asymptomatic period, and with proper care, many cats can live just as long as uninfected ones. It can be prevented by keeping cats indoors and avoiding contact with other cats.</p>\n    <h2>What Is FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus)?</h2>\n    <p>FeLV is transmitted through saliva and nasal discharge and affects the immune system and blood cell production. It tends to have more serious consequences than FIV, but it can be prevented through vaccination.</p>\n    <h2>When to Get Tested</h2>\n    <p>Testing is recommended before welcoming a new cat and before starting a multi-cat household. Reputable breeders conduct virus testing before handing over kittens.</p>\n    <h2>Fuluck Cattery's Approach</h2>\n    <p>At Fuluck Cattery, we perform virus tests on all kittens before handover and share the results with our clients. We are committed to thorough health management so you can welcome your new kitten with complete peace of mind.</p>"
