    "content": "<p>For longhaired cats such as Siberians and British Longhairs, regular brushing is essential care for maintaining a healthy coat.</p>\n    <h2>Brushing Frequency</h2>\n    <p>Normally 2-3 times per week is recommended, with daily brushing during shedding season (spring and fall). The Siberian's triple coat is water-resistant and relatively tangle-resistant, but the armpits, inner thighs, and rear area are prone to matting.</p>\n    <h2>Recommended Tools</h2>\n    <p>Ideally, have three tools: a slicker brush (for detangling), a comb (for finishing), and a Furminator (for undercoat removal). Start by combing through the entire coat, then use the slicker brush to gently work out any tangles.</p>\n    <h2>Tips for Reluctant Cats</h2>\n    <p>Start with short sessions and gradually build up. Use treats to create a positive association with brushing. At Fuluck Cattery, we practice brushing with kittens from an early age, so they transition smoothly to home grooming care.</p>\n    "

    "content": "<p>对于西伯利亚猫和英国长毛猫等长毛猫来说，定期梳毛是保持被毛健康不可或缺的护理。</p>\n    <h2>梳毛频率</h2>\n    <p>通常建议每周2-3次，换毛季（春季和秋季）最好每天进行。西伯利亚猫的三层被毛具有防水性，相对不容易打结，但腋下、大腿内侧和臀部周围是容易形成毛结的部位。</p>\n    <h2>推荐工具</h2>\n    <p>理想情况下准备三种工具：针梳（用于解开缠结）、排梳（用于最后整理）和祛毛刷（用于去除底毛）。先用排梳梳理整体被毛，发现缠结时再用针梳轻柔地解开。</p>\n    <h2>猫咪抗拒时的技巧</h2>\n    <p>从短时间开始，逐步延长。利用零食让猫咪将\"梳毛=好事\"联系起来。福楽猫舍从幼猫时期就开始进行梳毛练习，因此接回家后也能顺利进行护理。</p>\n    "
