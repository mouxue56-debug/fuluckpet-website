    "content": "<p>The British Longhair (BLH) is the long-haired version of the British Shorthair. Retaining the Shorthair\\'s calm personality with a fluffy long coat, this charming breed has been growing in popularity in recent years.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics of the British Longhair</h2>\n<p>The basic body type and facial features are the same as the British Shorthair, but the rich medium-to-long coat is the key difference. Chocolate golden colorations are particularly beautiful, and their teddy bear-like appearance is very popular.</p>\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n<p>Like the British Shorthair, they have a calm and gentle temperament. While they have an independent streak, they have deep affection for their family and are the type to quietly enjoy spending time together.</p>\n<h2>Coat Care</h2>\n<p>As a long-haired breed, brushing 2\u20133 times per week is recommended. During shedding season (spring and fall), daily brushing is ideal. Pay careful attention to areas prone to matting such as the underarms and belly. At Fuluck Cattery, we train kittens to get accustomed to brushing from an early age.</p>"
