    "content": "<p>Cats are descended from desert-dwelling ancestors, so they tend not to drink much water. However, adequate hydration is essential for maintaining kidney health.</p>\n    <h2>Recommended Daily Water Intake</h2>\n    <p>The guideline is approximately 40-60 ml per kilogram of body weight per day. For a 4 kg cat, that is about 160-240 ml. This includes water content from wet food.</p>\n    <h2>Tips to Encourage Drinking</h2>\n    <p>Place water bowls in multiple locations. For cats that prefer flowing water, use an automatic water fountain. Some cats may find lukewarm water easier to drink. Supplementing with wet food is also an effective strategy.</p>\n    <h2>Signs of Dehydration</h2>\n    <p>If you gently pinch the skin on the back of the neck and it does not spring back immediately, dehydration may be present. Dry gums and sunken eyes are also warning signs to watch for.</p>\n    "
