    "content": "<p>A cat's purr is one of the most charming characteristics of cats. Let's explore the science behind how it works and what it means.</p>\n<h2>How Purring Works</h2><p>Purring is produced by the larynx (throat muscles) vibrating 25 to 150 times per second. A distinctive feature is that the sound continues during both inhalation and exhalation, a mechanism unique to felines.</p>\n<h2>What Purring Means</h2>\n<h3>Contentment and Relaxation</h3><p>The most common reason. Cats purr when being petted, after meals, and when they are in a comfortable spot.</p>\n<h3>Requesting Something</h3><p>The purr that means \"I want food\" has a subtly different frequency from a normal purr. Research has found it contains elements similar to a human baby's cry.</p>\n<h3>Self-Healing</h3><p>Cats sometimes purr when injured or sick. Studies suggest that the vibrations promote bone repair and wound healing, and it is thought to be a natural self-healing mechanism.</p>\n<h2>Health Benefits for Humans</h2><p>A cat's purr has been shown to lower the human stress hormone cortisol and reduce blood pressure. Research has also found that living with a cat can reduce the risk of heart attack by 40%.</p>"
