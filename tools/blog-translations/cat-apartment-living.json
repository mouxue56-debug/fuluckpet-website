    "content": "<p>More and more people are keeping cats in apartments each year. Here we explain the key considerations for apartment living and tips for a comfortable coexistence.</p>\n<h2>What to Check in Pet-Friendly Properties</h2>\n<p>Even \"pet-friendly\" properties may have restrictions on the number of pets (e.g., 1\u20132 only), type restrictions (e.g., small dogs and cats only), or weight limits. Always check the building management rules. Properties listed as \"pets negotiable\" often come with conditions, so confirm with the management company in advance.</p>\n<p>When signing the lease, make sure to review any pet-related special clauses such as additional deposits and move-out cleaning fees.</p>\n<h2>Noise Prevention</h2>\n<p>The sound of a cat running around can carry to the floor below. Late-night \"zoomies\" are particularly problematic. Soundproofing mats and cork floor mats are effective solutions. Calm and relatively quiet breeds like the Siberian are well-suited for apartment living.</p>\n<h2>Odor Control</h2>\n<p>The basics include frequent litter box cleaning (at least twice daily), using highly deodorizing cat litter, installing an air purifier, and regular ventilation. Placing the litter box near an exhaust fan is particularly effective.</p>\n<h2>Escape Prevention</h2>\n<p>Escape or falls from high-rise apartments can be life-threatening. To prevent escapes through windows or the front door, always install screen door stoppers and escape prevention gates at the entrance. Restricting access to the balcony is also recommended.</p>\n<h2>Preventing Move-Out Disputes</h2>\n<p>Scratching damage on wallpaper and floor scratches are common sources of disputes. Install multiple scratching posts and apply pet-protection sheets to walls for peace of mind. Take preventive measures daily to avoid high cleaning costs when you move out.</p>"

    "content": "<p>在公寓养猫的人逐年增加。下面讲解集合住宅特有的注意事项和舒适生活的要点。</p>\n<h2>宠物可养房源的确认事项</h2>\n<p>即使是\"可养宠物\"的房源，也可能有数量限制（如限1~2只）、种类限制（如仅限小型犬和猫）、体重限制等。务必确认管理规约。\"宠物可商议\"的房源多为有条件的，需要事先向物业管理公司确认。</p>\n<p>签约时要仔细确认与宠物饲养相关的特别条款，如追加押金、退租时的清洁费用等。</p>\n<h2>噪音对策</h2>\n<p>猫跑动的声音可能会传到楼下。尤其是深夜的\"运动会\"需要特别注意。铺设隔音垫或软木地垫很有效。像西伯利亚猫这样性格温和、相对安静的猫种，非常适合在集合住宅饲养。</p>\n<h2>除臭对策</h2>\n<p>基本做法是勤清理猫厕所（每天至少2次）、使用除臭效果好的猫砂、安装空气净化器、定期通风。猫厕所放在换气扇附近效果更好。</p>\n<h2>防逃措施</h2>\n<p>从高层公寓逃跑或坠落可能危及生命。为防止从窗户或玄关逃跑，务必安装纱窗锁扣和玄关防逃栅栏。建议也限制猫进入阳台。</p>\n<h2>预防退租纠纷</h2>\n<p>墙纸的抓痕、地板的划痕是常见的纠纷来源。多设置猫抓板，墙面贴上宠物保护贴膜可以更安心。日常做好防护措施，避免退租时产生高额清洁费用。</p>"
