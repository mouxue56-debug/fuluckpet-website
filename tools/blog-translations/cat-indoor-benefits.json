    "title": "5 Benefits of Keeping Cats Indoors: Why You Shouldn't Let Your Cat Outside",
    "content": "<p>Keeping cats exclusively indoors is the recommended approach for modern cat ownership. Here are five major benefits.</p>\n<h2>1. Zero Risk of Traffic Accidents</h2>\n<p>Traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of death for outdoor cats. Visibility is especially low at night and on rainy days, increasing the risk of accidents. Keeping your cat indoors eliminates this risk entirely.</p>\n<h2>2. Protection from Infectious Diseases</h2>\n<p>FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) and FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus) are transmitted through fights or contact with stray cats. The coronavirus that causes FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) can also be contracted from outdoor cats. Indoor living prevents these infections.</p>\n<h2>3. Parasite Prevention</h2>\n<p>The risk of parasite infections from fleas, ticks, roundworms, and tapeworms is dramatically reduced. This also saves on the cost and stress of preventive medications.</p>\n<h2>4. More Than Double the Average Lifespan</h2>\n<p>Data shows that indoor cats have an average lifespan of 15-20 years, compared to 7-10 years for cats that go outside. Keeping cats indoors significantly contributes to their longevity.</p>\n<h2>5. Prevention of Neighborhood Conflicts</h2>\n<p>You can completely avoid neighborhood disputes related to cats damaging others' gardens, waste issues, or noise complaints.</p>\n    <h2>Keeping Indoor Cats Entertained</h2>\n<p>Encourage vertical movement with a cat tree, install a cat walkway by the window so they can enjoy the outside view, and set aside 15-30 minutes each day for playtime. With these efforts, your cat can lead a fulfilling indoor life.</p>\n<p>Siberians are curious and playful cats, but they also have the adaptability to live comfortably in an indoor environment without stress.</p>"
