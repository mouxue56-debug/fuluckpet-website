    "content": "<p>Periodontal disease is extremely common in cats — approximately 80% of cats over 3 years of age are affected by some form of oral disease. Regular dental care is key to prevention.</p>\n    <h2>Do Cats Really Need Their Teeth Brushed?</h2>\n    <p>Yes, dental care is important for cats too. When plaque hardens into tartar, it leads to periodontal disease, which if left untreated can result in tooth loss and even affect internal organs.</p>\n    <h2>How to Brush Your Cat's Teeth</h2>\n    <p>Use a cat-specific toothbrush and toothpaste. Rather than jumping straight to the toothbrush, start by getting your cat used to having their mouth area touched, then progress to wiping teeth with gauze, and finally advance to using a toothbrush.</p>\n    <h2>Alternatives When Brushing Is Difficult</h2>\n    <p>Dental care treats, water additives (dental rinses), and chew toys can serve as supplementary options. However, brushing with a toothbrush remains the most effective method of dental care.</p>"
