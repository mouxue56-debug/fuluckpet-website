    <li>🧳 <strong>Carrier</strong> — Top-opening type recommended for easy access. Also used for vet visits.</li>
    <li>🚽 <strong>Litter Box (large)</strong> — Siberians are big cats, so choose a roomy size. Hooded is OK too.</li>
    <li>🪨 <strong>Cat Litter</strong> — Best to use the same type as before. Sudden changes can cause litter box issues.</li>
    <li>🍽️ <strong>Food</strong> — We'll tell you what they're currently eating. Key point: don't switch suddenly.</li>
    <li>💧 <strong>Water Bowls ×2</strong> — Place in 2 spots for peace of mind. Ceramic or stainless steel stays clean.</li>

    <li>🖌️ <strong>Brush</strong> — Slicker brush recommended. 2-3 times a week is enough.</li>
    <li>🧹 <strong>Sanitizing Supplies</strong> — Pet-safe disinfectant spray is handy.</li>
    <li>📄 <strong>Pee Pads</strong> — Place inside the carrier or under the cage for extra safety.</li>

    <li>🧵 <strong>String, Yarn & Rubber Bands</strong> — Swallowing can cause intestinal blockage. Clean up immediately when spotted.</li>
    <li>💊 <strong>Small Objects (Medicine, Batteries, Accessories)</strong> — Store in sealed containers or drawers. Kittens put everything in their mouths.</li>
    <li>🚪 <strong>Doors & Gaps</strong> — Use door stoppers to prevent pinching. Check inside the washing machine too.</li>
    <li>🪟 <strong>Windows & Balconies</strong> — Install fall-prevention nets or window locks. Screen doors alone may not be enough.</li>

  <h2 class="guide-section-title">基本思路</h2>
  <p>磨爪是指甲护理和伸展运动，轻咬是玩耍和牙齿成长的需要。不是要"制止"，而是"引导到正确的地方和方式"。用替代物表扬而不是责骂，好习惯就会自然养成。</p>

<section class="guide-section">
  <h2 class="guide-section-title">磨爪对策</h2>
  <ul class="guide-list">
    <li>🪵 <strong>在2〜3个地方设置猫抓板</strong> — 通道旁·窝附近·窗边等经常经过的地方。</li>
    <li>🧱 <strong>尝试不同材质和形状</strong> — 麻绳·瓦楞纸·地毯·木材等。每只猫喜好不同。</li>
    <li>📐 <strong>准备立式·横式·斜面式</strong> — 配合伸展姿势选择。</li>
    <li>👏 <strong>用了就安静地表扬</strong> — 温柔的声音和零食强化好习惯。</li>
    <li>🏠 <strong>如果在家具上磨了就轻轻引导</strong> — 不要大声叫，轻轻带到猫抓板旁。</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="guide-note">
    💡 西伯利亚猫体型大，推荐稳固结实的猫抓板。

  <h2 class="guide-section-title">轻咬对策</h2>
  <ul class="guide-list">
    <li>✋ <strong>不要用手当玩具</strong> — 从小猫开始就用玩具的习惯。</li>
    <li>⏸️ <strong>咬了就暂停玩耍</strong> — 安静离开等2〜3分钟，冷静后再继续。</li>
    <li>⏰ <strong>每天10〜15分钟游戏时间</strong> — 分早晚两次最有效释放精力。</li>
    <li>🧸 <strong>准备可以咬的玩具</strong> — 踢抱枕和有嚼劲的玩具替代。</li>
    <li>🌡️ <strong>兴奋过度前休息</strong> — 耳朵向后倒就该冷静一下了。</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="guide-note">
    💡 轻咬在换牙期（3〜6个月）会加重。冰过的湿毛巾或磨牙玩具有帮助。随着成长自然会好转，不用着急。

    ⚠️ 大声骂·打·泼水（会造成恐惧，破坏信任关系）<br>
